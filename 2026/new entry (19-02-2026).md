Personal Note: On Time and the Weight of Caregiving
Today, this log is not about code; it is about the process. I need to apologize to myself.

I have been trying to stay disciplined with my Software Engineering and AI studies, but the reality at home has been exhausting. With my grandfather now completely dependent on me, the energy left to sit in front of the computer is minimal. Even when I have some free time, mental fatigue is louder than the will to program.

I want to record that:

I am trying to focus on my future and my growth, but I feel like I am failing most of the time.

The guilt of not studying as much as I would like weighs as much as the caregiving routine.

I will try to use my phone to read and study when I cannot be at the PC, respecting my own limits.

This is a request for patience with myself. The path to Europe in 2030 is still there, but today, the pace is slower.
