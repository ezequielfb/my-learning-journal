# Entry 01: Environment Setup and Python Script
**Date:** 2025-12-13

## Goal of the Day
Configure the development environment (Git, GitHub, VS Code) and write a basic Python script using lists and loops.

## What I Learned
- **Git Flow:** specifically the `clone` -> `add` -> `commit` -> `push` cycle.
- **Python:** How to iterate over a list using `for` and basic arithmetic operations.
- **Markdown:** How to structure documentation.

## AI Collaboration Log
*This section documents how I used AI to accelerate my learning today.*

- **My Role (Architect):** I defined that I needed a repository structure and a basic script to calculate grades.
- **AI Role (Co-pilot):** The AI provided the syntax for the `for` loop which I wasn't sure about.
- **Prompt Used:** "Create a Python script that calculates the average of grades in a list."
- **Verification:** I ran the code locally to ensure the logic was sound before pushing.

## Next Steps
- Study Python functions (`def`) to organize the code better.
